# Data Transformation
Internship test.

## Step 1
As the company asked, I had to extract from the pdf (./pdf/tiss.pdf) the data from the boards 30, 31 and 32.

## Step 2
The next thing was to save this data on csvs tables (./files/filename.csv).

## Step 3
Finally, I needed to zip all the csvs files in another file (./Teste_Intuitive_Care_Giovanna_Bueno.zip).

## Run the code!
The main class (App.java) is in the root directory.

``ATENTION!`` See the ``settings.json`` file, because this project has referenced libraries. You'll need to download the libraries and save it on the path determinated for me, or change the path on the json file.
